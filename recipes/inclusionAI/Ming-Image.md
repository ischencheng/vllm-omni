# Ming-Image 0.1 Design

> Text-to-image, image editing, and layer decomposition.

## Summary

- Vendor: inclusionAI
- Models: `inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design` and `inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design-Layer`
- Runtime: vLLM-Omni two-stage online serving
- API: OpenAI-compatible chat completions

## Architecture

Stage 0 uses a Qwen2.5-VL vision tower plus a 20-layer BailingMoeV2 language model.
It appends 256 learned image-query tokens and exports the final query states plus direct VLM states from layers 5, 12, and 20.
The query-token checkpoint is in the root sibling `mlp/` directory, so remote stage-0 materialization downloads both `mllm/` and `mlp/`.

Stage 1 projects those conditions through the checkpoint connector and runs a 30-layer Z-Image DiT with a Qwen-Image RGBA VAE.

For Design-Layer, the first returned image is the reconstructed composite and the remaining images are the requested layers.

## CUDA

### Environment

- OS: Linux
- Python: 3.10+
- CUDA: 13.0
- vLLM version: 0.29.0
- vLLM-Omni version or commit: 59db6a428
- 2x H100 80GB (1xH100 to be validated)

### Commands

```bash
MODEL=inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design
vllm serve "$MODEL" --omni --deploy-config vllm_omni/deploy/ming_image.yaml --port 8091
```

For layer decomposition, set `MODEL` to `inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design-Layer`.

## Text-to-image

Note that a prompt refiner is expected to describe the prompts with details; we will refine with more example inputs soon.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "A clean editorial botanical poster"}],
    "modalities": ["image"],
    "extra_body": {
      "height": 1024, "width": 1024,
      "steps": 12, "cfg": 1.0, "seed": 42
    }
  }' \
  | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content[0].image_url.url | split(",")[1]' \
  | base64 -d > ming_design_smoke.png
```

## Request batching

Design text-to-image requests can share a denoising wave while retaining their
own prompt conditions and seeds. Each request returns one RGBA image. Requests
must have matching height, width, inference steps, guidance and layer count;
their combined query and direct condition length must also round up to the same
multiple of 32. Different prompt lengths within that bucket and independent
seeds can share a wave. For example, with 256 query tokens, direct conditions of
28 and 31 tokens share a 288-token bucket; 39 direct tokens use a separate
320-token bucket. This restriction preserves the transformer's single-request
padding and rotary positions. Requests in different buckets run in separate
waves.

To enable a two-request wave, copy `vllm_omni/deploy/ming_image.yaml` to a custom
deployment file and set `max_num_seqs: 2` in both stages, `max_inflight: 2` on the
stage edge, and `request_batch_max_wait_ms: 50` in Stage 1. Launch with
`--deploy-config /path/to/ming_image_batch.yaml` and submit two concurrent
text-to-image requests. The admission wait is an upper bound for coalescing
arrivals; it does not guarantee that every wave contains two requests.

Batching correctness was checked with eager execution. Set `enforce_eager: true`
in Stage 1 to reproduce that mode; validate regional compilation separately.

Image editing and Design-Layer requests run individually, including when the
configured concurrency is greater than one. Batching uses complete denoising
waves; requests arriving during a wave wait for a later wave. Warm up each batch
size as well as each image shape before measuring performance.

## Image editing

Pass one input image and an editing instruction:

```bash
MODEL=inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design
INPUT_IMAGE=/path/to/input.png

jq -n \
  --arg model "$MODEL" \
  --rawfile image <(base64 -w0 "$INPUT_IMAGE") \
  '{
    model: $model,
    messages: [{role: "user", content: [
      {type: "image_url", image_url: {url: ("data:image/png;base64," + $image)}},
      {type: "text", text: "Change the background to blue"}
    ]}],
    modalities: ["image"],
    extra_body: {
      height: 1024, width: 1024,
      steps: 12, cfg: 1.0, seed: 42
    }
  }' |
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @- \
  | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content[0].image_url.url | split(",")[1]' \
  | base64 -d > ming_edit.png
```

## Layer decomposition

Use the Design-Layer checkpoint and set `INPUT_IMAGE` to a local flattened design image.
Note that the prompt should better depict each layer to be decomposed, we will refine with more example inputs soon.

```bash
MODEL=inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design-Layer
INPUT_IMAGE=/path/to/input.png
PROMPT="Decompose this design into editable visual layers"

jq -n \
  --arg model "$MODEL" \
  --rawfile image <(base64 -w0 "$INPUT_IMAGE") \
  --arg prompt "$PROMPT" \
  '{
    model: $model,
    messages: [{role: "user", content: [
      {type: "image_url", image_url: {url: ("data:image/png;base64," + $image)}},
      {type: "text", text: $prompt}
    ]}],
    modalities: ["image"],
    extra_body: {
      num_layers: 6,
      height: 1024, width: 1024,
      steps: 12, cfg: 2.0, seed: 42
    }
  }' |
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @- > response.json

jq -r '.choices[0].message.content[].image_url.url | split(",")[1]' response.json |
  nl -v 0 |
  while read -r index data; do
    printf "%s" "$data" | base64 -d > "ming_layer_${index}.png"
  done
```

## Notes

- The default deployment keeps Stage 0 eager and enables dynamic regional
  compilation with CUDA Graph Trees for the repeated Stage 1 DiT blocks.
  The first request for each new image shape or layer count pays compilation
  and graph-capture cost; warm up every production shape before measuring or
  serving latency-sensitive traffic.
- Each image-editing or Design-Layer request accepts one reference image and runs individually.
- Design-Layer requires a reference image except during warmup.
- A non-empty `negative_prompt` is rejected; Ming-Image uses zero negative conditioning.
- Height and width must be divisible by 16.
- Returned images retain the checkpoint's four RGBA channels.
